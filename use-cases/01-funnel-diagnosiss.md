# Funnel Diagnosis (without waiting for data team)

## Problem
I need a fast funnel diagnosis, but I’m tired of waiting for dashboards, SQL, or “we’ll check it”.

## Solution
Use a simple table (Sheets) + AI to spot bottlenecks and propose tests.

## Steps
1. Export last 30 days funnel data (sessions, leads, checkout, purchases).
2. Paste into Google Sheets.
3. Add columns: Conversion Rate, Drop-off %, Notes.
4. Ask AI:
   - identify the biggest bottleneck
   - list 5 likely causes
   - propose 10 experiments ranked by impact/effort
5. Turn top 3 experiments into tasks with owner, KPI and deadline.

## Result
A working diagnosis in 30 minutes, not 2 weeks.

## Limitations
If tracking is broken, AI can’t guess truth. Fix measurement first.
