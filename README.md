# No-Code (But It Works)

This repository exists for one simple reason:

I’m a marketing & growth consultant.
I’m tired of waiting for developers to do simple things.

## What this is
- Practical AI and no-code solutions
- Marketing, growth and performance use cases
- MVPs that work before they look pretty
- Systems built to answer business questions, not technical ones

## What this is NOT
- A developer portfolio
- Clean architecture playground
- Overengineered abstractions
- “Let’s refactor later” experiments

## Core belief
If a solution needs a long technical explanation to justify itself,
it’s probably solving the wrong problem.

## Why no-code + AI
Because most marketing problems don’t need:
- custom backends
- 3 sprints
- a Jira board
- or a philosophical discussion about scalability

They need answers.
Fast.

## Who this is for
- Marketing consultants
- Growth leaders
- Founders who actually execute
- Anyone tired of being blocked by “technical complexity”

If you’re a developer and this feels offensive:
good.
It’s not for you.

## Rule of thumb
If I can’t prototype it myself,
the idea is not ready yet.
