# No-Code (But It Works)

I’m a marketing & growth consultant.

I build AI + no-code solutions because I got tired of waiting for developers to explain simple things badly.

## What this is
- Practical AI and no-code solutions for growth & performance marketing
- MVPs that work before they look pretty
- Systems that answer business questions fast

## What this is NOT
- A developer portfolio
- Overengineered architecture
- “This is complex” excuses

## Core belief
If a solution needs a long technical explanation to justify itself,
it’s probably solving the wrong problem.
